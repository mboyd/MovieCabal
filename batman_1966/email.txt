Salutations, ladies and gentlemen. 

It has come to our attention that our previous film selections have been described as "high-brow", "austere", and "what the hell?"

Well, as you may already know, our next feature is a fan favorite, a well-beloved movie about great men who changed the world. Men who dared to journey into the night, and never looked back. It is time for a movie about endless training, hard work, and generally having "the right stuff". 

Yes, it's that time.

BAT TIME.

Batman (1966). Goodale lounge. Sunday, 11PM.
