Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

Following our tradition of providing clear, reliable information regarding the semi-public (that is to say, semi-private) dissemination of high-quality content of a filmographic nature, we present to you an offering that is probably dissimilar to any offering that has previously been made to you in a similar context.

Join us for an evening of Italian neo-realism and cultural edification as we watch the classic film The Bicycle Thief, this Saturday at 8pm in Goodale lounge. Should the movie inspire you to indulge in primal acts of bicycle-thievery, note that the bikes have already been moved to the Goodale basement for their own safety.

For a more detailed explanation of our choice, please see the following link: http://mit.edu/~mboyd/www/bicycle.html
(Note: if the audio does not work, it is because Chuck has deemed you unworthy of viewing this film. We are not responsible for the actions of Chuck. Watch this film at your own risk).

Cordially yours,
1E Movie Cabal
