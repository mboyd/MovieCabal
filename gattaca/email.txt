Ladies and gentlemen!

The 1E Movie Cabal, recently formed from the shadowy intersection of fascist politics and good taste, invites you to join us this evening for an event guaranteed to stimulate both your photoreceptors and frontal cortices.  This week we present Gattaca, a 1997 sci-fi drama about genetic modification and eugenics.  Eligibility for this event will be limited to those of superior genetic makeup -- please deposit blood samples on the Free Food table by 5PM to allow time for taste-testing by our blood-savant iguana, Chuck.

Lest you think you'll soon be free of our shadowy grasp, the 1E Movie Cabal wishes you to prepare yourselves for classy-movie-showing-as-weekly-occurrence, or suffer the consequences.  Those determined to have inferior taste will be sacrificed to a gold-plated statuette of Stanley Kubrick.

  Long live the cinema!
