Salutations!

This week, we continue our double feature series with two classic examples of film noir: The Third Man and The Maltese Falcon. 

By now, we know that your faith in our assertions of cinematic quality is so unshakeable that further convincing is not necessary. Indeed, the mere suggestion that you wouldn't mindlessly fawn over our every word is surely insulting to you. Nevertheless, we insist on providing the following supplementary information; failure to do so would result in...undesirable consequences.
