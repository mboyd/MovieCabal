Good day, Comrades:

This week's soul-enriching experience is Doctor Zhivago, an epic drama-romance set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution, along with lots of snow. At the strike of 8 on the eve of November 9, we will march upon Goodale Lounge and seize the means of production! And the TV, also.

To enhance the cinematic experience, we will pause the film every five minutes. This will give us time to go outside, remove our clothing, and roll around in the snow until our bodies are completely numb, thus facilitating a greater appreciation for the film's panoply of hyperborean motifs.

Should you need more convincing, please direct your attention to the following rendition of the film's theme, as played by gracefully falling snow:

Once again, if the audio/animation doesn't work, it is because you have failed to sufficiently appease our glorious leader Chuck. Remember: he is always watching.

From Russia with love,

1E Movie Cabal Workers' and Peasants' Army
