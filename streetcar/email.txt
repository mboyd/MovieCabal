Uncultured peasants (and other esteemed colleagues):

It has been brought to our attention that, due to some other, minor holiday, many of you will not be able to partake in the weekly celebration known as 1E Movie Cabal Presents. No matter - the show must go on, even if nobody is there to see it. This week's fleeting escape from the inevitability of death is A Streetcar Named Desire, or perhaps more accurately, A Movie Named A Streetcar Named Desire.

Should you need more assurance of the film's quality, you may refer to the script of the play on which it is based, available here (in somewhat condensed form):

Existentially,
1E Movie Cabal

P.S. Our scientists are still investigating the causes of last week's movie showing; we will keep you posted as details emerge. We've picked up on a peculiar magnetic field anomaly near Memphis, TN, which we suspect may be involved...
