Good evening!

As you know, it's a very special time of year - a time when, for a few fleeting moments, we can step back and enjoy all the things that bring us true joy. Yes, it's the Intellectual Appreciation Period, and we would like to celebrate with a series of double features, brought to you every Saturday night. This week, we celebrate the classier side of Monty Python with two Python-born films: Terry Gilliam's Brazil (at 8pm) and Terry Jones' Life of Brian (at ~10:30pm).

By now you should be sufficiently convinced of our supreme cultural erudition to take our movie recommendations on blind faith. But for all the Missourians out there, the following page should give you all the information you need to know: http://web.mit.edu/~mboyd/www/python.html

Probably yours,
